# air-quality-analysis

* Performed descriptive data mining on a global air quality dataset to identify patterns and relationships between countries, pollutants, and pollution levels using techniques like the Apriori algorithm.
* Discovered significant association rules, such as the high likelihood of China experiencing medium pollution levels for pollutants like O3, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2, and the United States having high pollution of O3.
* Developed a predictive data mining model using KNN to predict the continent where a pollutant is likely found based on its type and pollution category, achieving an accuracy of up to 70.54%.
* Demonstrated the KNN model's ability to consistently predict pollutant levels across different continents and pollution categories, indicating its potential for understanding regional pollution patterns.
